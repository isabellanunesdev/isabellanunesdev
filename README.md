### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

💡 Hello! I'm a Computer Science bachelor and a Software Engineer. Dedicated to continuously enhancing code quality and optimizing software performance.

🌱 I am currently learning [Go](https://go.dev/) language and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

✉️ You can shoot me an [email](mailto:isadfrn@gmail.com) and I'll try to respond as soon as I can.

📄 Please have a look at my [personal page](https://isadfrn.dev/) for more details about me.

⚠️ I use my GitHub with my students, my work, as a sandbox for learning and also for my side projects. So there is a lot of repositories here, with multiples programming languages and spoken languages. I try to make it the most organized as possible, but if you want to see the projects as a portfolio, please check my [personal page](https://isadfrn.dev/portfolio) for a detailed view.
