### About Me

- Hello! I'm a Computer Science Bachelor, a Master's student of Applied Computing, and a Software Engineer. I'm currently working with RFID on a WebApplication and developing a research about how to use IA to help scientists to run testbeds on a cybersecurity platform to tests malicious behavior related to IOT environments.

- I am currently learning [Go](https://go.dev/).

- You can shoot me an [email](mailto:isadfrn@gmail.com) and I'll try to respond as soon as I can.

- I use my GitHub with my students, and my work, as a sandbox for learning and also for my side projects. So there are a lot of repositories here, with multiple programming languages and spoken languages. I try to make it the most organized as possible, but if you want to see the projects as a portfolio, please check my [personal page](https://isabellanunes.dev/) for a detailed view.
